[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/widop/WidopGoogleAnalyticsBundle.png)](http://travis-ci.org/widop/WidopGoogleAnalyticsBundle)

The `WidopGoogleAnalyticsBundle` provides a way to use certificate-based authentication in server-to-server
interactions with google analytics.

In other words, no user interaction will be required thanks to the "PKCS 12" certificate and you will be able to
automate your google analytics authentication and authorization processes as well as the way of querying the
google analytics service.
